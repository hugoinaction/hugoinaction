In geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90-degree angles, or (100-gradian angles or right angles). It can also be defined as a rectangle in which two adjacent sides have equal length. A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted ◻ ABCD. <!--more-->

## Characterizations

A convex quadrilateral is a square if and only if it is any one of the following

* a rectangle with two adjacent equal sides
* a rhombus with a right vertex angle
* a rhombus with all angles equal
* a parallelogram with one right vertex angle and two adjacent equal sides
* a quadrilateral with four equal sides and four right angles
* a quadrilateral where the diagonals are equal and are the perpendicular bisectors of each other, i.e. a rhombus with equal diagonals
* a convex quadrilateral with successive sides a, b, c, d whose area is A = 1/2(a<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>) =  1/2(b<sup>2</sup> + d<sup>2</sup>)

## Properties
A square is a special case of a rhombus (equal sides, opposite equal angles), a kite (two pairs of adjacent equal sides), a trapezoid (one pair of opposite sides parallel), a parallelogram (all opposite sides parallel), a quadrilateral or tetragon (four-sided polygon), and a rectangle (opposite sides equal, right-angles) and therefore has all the properties of all these shapes, namely:

* The diagonals of a square bisect each other and meet at 90°
* The diagonals of a square bisect its angles.
* Opposite sides of a square are both parallel and equal in length.
* All four angles of a square are equal. (Each is 360°/4 = 90°, so every angle of a square is a right angle.)
* All four sides of a square are equal.
* The diagonals of a square are equal.
* The square is the n=2 case of the families of n-hypercubes and n-orthoplexes.
* A square has Schläfli symbol. A truncated square, t, is an octagon. An alternated square, h, is a digon.

## Other facts

* A square can also be defined as a parallelogram with equal diagonals that bisect the angles.
* If a figure is both a rectangle (right angles) and a rhombus (equal edge lengths), then it is a square.
* If a circle is circumscribed around a square, the area of the circle is π / 2 (about 1.5708) times the area of the square.
* If a circle is inscribed in the square, the area of the circle is π / 4 (about 0.7854) times the area of the square.
* A square has a larger area than any other quadrilateral with the same perimeter.
* A square tiling is one of three regular tilings of the plane (the others are the equilateral triangle and the regular hexagon).
* The square is in two families of polytopes in two dimensions: hypercube and the cross-polytope.
* The square is a highly symmetric object. There are four lines of reflectional symmetry and it has rotational symmetry of order 4 (through 90°, 180° and 270°). Its symmetry group is the dihedral group D4.
