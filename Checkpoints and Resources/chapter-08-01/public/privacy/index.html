<p><strong><em>We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em></strong></p>
<p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Policy.</p>

<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days .</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-keep-your-information-safe">HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
<p><strong><em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></strong></p>
<p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.</p>
<h2 id="do-we-collect-information-from-minors">DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>

<p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dpo@exmaple.org">dpo@exmaple.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-your-privacy-rights">WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
<p><strong><em>In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></strong></p>
<p>In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
<h2 id="do-california-residents-have-specific-privacy-rights">DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
<p><strong><em>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em></strong></p>

We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.</p>
<h2 id="do-we-make-updates-to-this-policy">DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</h2>
<p><strong><em>Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</em></strong></p>
<p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.
